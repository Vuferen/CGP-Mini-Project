# CGP Mini-Project: Water Depth

![Water Depth](https://github.com/Vuferen/CGP-Mini-Project/blob/master/Water%20Depth.png "Water Depth")

This mini project covers the use of depth textures in transparent water. The project was inspired by a [water shader by Freya Holm√©r](https://twitter.com/freyaholmer/status/1184220893976977408).
The depth is used to create a color gradient in the water, as well as foam along the edge of the water.

The shader contains the following properties:
- _DeepColor - color of the deepest water
- _SurfaceColor - color of the water at the surface
- _DepthScale - adjustment for how deep in the water the deepest color is
- _FoamColor - the color of the foam
- _FoamPercent - how much foam, as a percentage of the depth

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open with Unity
3. Open SampleScene
4. Press play
5. Adjust the properties to your liking
